      <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
      <p class="byline">By Evan Wild</p>
      
      <p>Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.</p>
      
      <p>So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.</p>
      
      <h3>Types of bear</h3>
      <p>Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.</p>

      <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
      <p>Wild bears eat a variety of meat, fish, fruit, nuts, and other naturally growing ingredients. In general they will hunt for food themselves in woodland or rivers.</p>
