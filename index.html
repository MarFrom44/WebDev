            <h2>The trouble with Bears</h2>
            <h3 class="byline">By Evan Wild</h3>
            
            <p>Tall, lumbering, angry, dangerous. The real live bears of this world are proud, independent creatures, self-serving and always on the hunt for food. Nothing like the bears you see on TV, like Baloo from renowned documentary, The Jungle Book.</p>
            
            <p>So what are bears really like, and why does the world's media portray them with such a skewed vision? In this article we try to answer those questions, and give you a real insight into the life of the bear.</p>
            
            <h3>Types of bear</h3>
            <p>Bears come in two varieties — large and medium. You don't get small bears. If you have seen a small bear, then it was in fact probably a baby bear (cub) from another species.</p>

            <h3>Habitats and Eating habits</h3>
            <p>Bears can also be classified in terms of their habitat — both large and medium bears are just as at home in urban areas as they are in the countryside.</p>

            <h3>Mating rituals</h3>
